## Features

- **Receipt Upload and Scanning**:  
  Users can upload receipts for automated extraction of key financial information such as:
  - Amount
  - Date
  - Time
  - Transaction type
  - Recipient details
  - Sender details
  - Remarks (if available)
  
- **AI-Powered Information Extraction**:  
  The app utilizes a Generative AI model (`gemini-1.5-pro`) to analyze receipts and extract relevant financial data automatically.

- **Financial Summaries**:  
  Provides users with a breakdown of:
  - Current Balance
  - Total Income
  - Total Expenses
  - Recent Transactions

- **Secure Login**:  
  Requires user authentication to access the dashboard and features, ensuring data security.

- **Export Financial Data**:  
  Users can download financial summaries for their records.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:  
  - Python with Flask framework
  - Firebase Firestore (database for data storage)
  - Google Generative AI (`gemini-1.5-pro`) for OCR and information extraction

- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML templates (e.g., `dashboard.html`) for user interface design
  - Jinja2 for dynamic rendering of financial data

- **Other Dependencies**:  
  - PIL (Pillow library) for receipt image processing
  - `dotenv` for environment variable management
  - Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing
  - Flask-Session for user session management

## How It Works

1. **Login Required**:  
   Users must log in using secure credentials to access features like uploading a receipt.

2. **Receipt Processing**:  
   - Navigate to the dashboard and upload a receipt using the file uploader.
   - The receipt image is processed using Generative AI to extract details.

3. **Data Extraction**:  
   - The app uses regex patterns to parse extracted text for specific information such as amount, date, time, and transaction types.

4. **Review Transactions**:  
   - Scanned results are displayed on the dashboard for categorizing as income or expense.
   - Users can save this information for future references.

5. **Financial Summary**:  
   - The dashboard provides a live overview of your current balance, total income, and expenses.
   - Recent transactions are also listed for quick access.

6. **Export Data**:  
   - Users can download a detailed financial summary for offline use.
